## How to use
All userstyles themes may be used via [Stylus](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiR882g1f3XAhUQ3mMKHUv9BzkQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Faddons.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Ffirefox%2Faddon%2Fstyl-us%2F&usg=AOvVaw18flDCoRX0_lteO64rZeYi) or [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/).

In order to install themes from the Firefox folder, simply open Firefox, go to about:profiles, open the root directory, and apply any changes you want inside that folder. Note that each folder found within the Firefox folder of this git correspond to which folder they belong within the root directory.
Each file has a comment at the top saying what it must be renamed to in order to apply it. Any files that must be renamed to the same as another file must be combined. In order to do so, simply copy+paste the css at the bottom.
