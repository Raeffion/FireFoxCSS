## How to use
All userstyles themes may be used via [Stylus](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiR882g1f3XAhUQ3mMKHUv9BzkQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Faddons.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Ffirefox%2Faddon%2Fstyl-us%2F&usg=AOvVaw18flDCoRX0_lteO64rZeYi) or [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/).

I've removed my Firefox themes as [ShadowFox](https://overdodactyl.github.io/ShadowFox/) now removes the need.
